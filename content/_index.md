Hello everyone this is **my** special corner of the internet. I'm just an
avarage guy with some dreams and special interrests and here's the place where
I blab about technology or just random thoughs about those said interrests.

I'm really glad that you found this place, enjoy your stay! Maybe you learn
something new, or just watch me growing to be ~~a better/worse person~~
something as I write by.

$\neg \exists h \mid L(h) \land H(h)$
